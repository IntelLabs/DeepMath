Question: A parabola with equation $y=x^2+bx+c$ passes through the points $(-1,-11)$ and $(3,17)$. What is $c$?

Let's write down an equation for the parabola and solve for $c$ using sympy.
<tool_call>
import sympy as sp

# define the symbols
x, y, b, c = sp.symbols('x y b c')

# define the parabola equation
parabola_eq = sp.Eq(y, x**2 + b*x + c)

# the parabola passes through the points (-1,-11) and (3,17)
# so we substitute these points into the parabola equation
point_1 = parabola_eq.subs({x: -1, y: -11})
point_2 = parabola_eq.subs({x: 3, y: 17})

# we now have two equations and two unknowns (b and c)
# we will solve for b and c
solutions = sp.solve((point_1,point_2), (b, c))
solutions[c]
</tool_call>

```output
-7
```
So c is \boxed{-7}

Question: At the 2007 Math Olympics, Team Canada won $17$ out of a possible $100$ medals. Which one of the following is closest to the fraction of medals that they won? $$\n\frac{1}{4} \qquad \frac{1}{5} \qquad \frac{1}{6} \qquad \frac{1}{7} \qquad \frac{1}{8}\n$$

Let's use sympy to print out the differences between the fraction of medals that Canada won and each of the options.
<tool_call>
from sympy import Rational, Abs

# team Canada won 17 out of 100 medals
medal_frac = Rational(17, 100)

# list of options
options = [Rational(1, 4), Rational(1, 5), Rational(1, 6), Rational(1, 7), Rational(1, 8)]

# let's print out the differences
[Abs(medal_frac - frac_option) for frac_option in options]
</tool_call>

```output
[2/25, 3/100, 1/300, 19/700, 9/200]
```

Let's now check which difference is the smallest.
<tool_call>
import numpy as np

# Calculate the idx of the closest option
min_idx = np.argmin([2/25, 3/100, 1/300, 19/700, 9/200])

# Print the closest option
print(options[min_idx])
</tool_call>

```output
1/6
```

So the answer is \boxed{1/6}.

Question: A rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112. What is $r$?

Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$.
The sum of the box's edges is $4(x + y + z)$ and the surface area is $2xy + 2yz + 2xz$.
The diameter of the sphere is $2r$ and it's equal to the diagonal of the box.
Let's now write down the equations based on the above information and solve them using sympy.

<tool_call>
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# define the variables
x, y, z, r = symbols('x y z r')

# equations based on the given information
eq1 = Eq(2 * (x*y + x*z + y*z), 384)
eq2 = Eq(4 * (x + y + z), 112)

# the diagonal of the box is the diameter of the sphere
diagonal_eq = Eq(x**2 + y**2 + z**2, (2*r)**2)

# solve the equations
solutions = solve((eq1, eq2, diagonal_eq), (x, y, z, r))

# let's see which values of r we get
[solution[-1] for solution in solutions]
</tool_call>

```output
[-10, -10, 10, 10]
```

Since the radius of the sphere is positive, we get $r = \boxed{10}$.

Question: A bee starts flying from point $P_0$. She flies $1$ inch due east to point $P_1$. For $j \ge 1$, once the bee reaches point $P_j$, she turns $30^{\circ}$ counterclockwise and then flies $j+1$ inches straight to point $P_{j+1}$. When the bee reaches $P_{2015},$ how far from $P_0$ is she, in inches?

We can represent the rotation action via $\omega = e^{\pi i/6}$.
Let's assume the bee starts at the origin, so $P_{2015}$ is at the point \[z = 1 + 2 \omega + 3 \omega^2 + 4 \omega^3 + \dots + 2015 \omega^{2014}.\]
This is an arithmetic-geometric series which we can solve by simplifying the expression.
Alternatively, we can solve for |z| using sympy using the following code.

<tool_call>
from sympy import I, pi, exp, sqrt

# rotation action of 30 degrees
omega = exp(I * pi/6)

position = 0

for i in range(2015):
    delta = (i + 1) * omega**(i)
    position += delta

real, img = (position.as_real_imag())
# Distance from origin i.e. starting point
dist = sqrt(real**2 + img**2)
print(dist)
</tool_call>

```output
sqrt(2)*(1008 + 1008*sqrt(3))
```

So the bee is $\boxed{1008\sqrt{2} + 1008\sqrt{6}}$ far from the starting point.
